                        Go is a programming language announced by Google in 2009 and released in 2012.
                        It is used in Google's production systems, as well as other companies and open source projects.
                        The programming language started as an experiment by 3 Google employees, Griesemer, Pike, and Thompson.
                        They sought to create a language that didn't have the same issues as other programming languages,
                        yet retains the positive benefits of those languages.
                        One of their focuses was their dislike for c++, and how they felt they could develop their own language that functioned better.
                        Their logo used to be a gopher, pictured below.
